In this processing animation, our group created a robot with arms and a jetpack attached flying through space. We had a robot class 
which takes in all the other "robot parts" classes and makes the whole robot. Within the robot class file, there is also a zigzag robot 
class which extends upon the robot class (the movement is zig zag instead of straight vertical). The RobotBody class creates the 
body (rectangle) of the robot, which can vary based off size. RobotHead class makes two different types of heads, a circular head vs a 
square head. The RobotJetpack class makes a jetpack on the robot, and it can vary by being on either the left size of the robot or the 
right. The RobotJetpackThruster class has an inner flame and an outer flame to represent rocket thruster flames. The Star class creates 
random stars that "fall down" creating a moving backgorund. 

The size differences between the different instances of the robots made it harder to figure out size of the other robot parts, 
because we had to think proportionally. 

We mostly worked on this together, Austin specialized in the star class, and the overall structure of how we were going to 
organize the heirarchies. Jerry specialized in the Robot, RobotBody, RobotHead. Paras specialized in RobotArm (we all worked on this collectively since it was the most complex), RobotJetpack, 
RobotJetpackThruster class. Austin worked to put everything together. Jerry added the audio, and Paras worked on the project description.
