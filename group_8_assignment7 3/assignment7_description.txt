

The game starts as soon as the file is run. The goal of the game is to get the highest score you can. The score and difficulty increase every time a weapon is picked up. There is no win condition, but the game ends when the player comes in contact with an enemy or an enemy reaches the flag. 

The classes are all fairly self explanatory. 
  The player is the player. It walks, jumps, and uses a weapon.
  Enemies move from left to right and kill the player in one hit.
  Weapons are weapons. Bullets are bullets and kill enemies. 
  Platforms are platforms (there is only one in the game).
  The HUD keeps track of the score and displays it.
  The box falls from the sky and brings with it a mystery weapon.
  The Handler is essentially the engine that runs the game. It checks for game pauses, lose conditions, and contact between objects. It creates new objects and enemies. 

The initial plan of the game was harder to implement than expected. Platforms were difficult to work with, so the project was restarted from scratch and a new game with a similar theme was created.

Jerry worked on enemies, weapons, bullets, and music. He also was responsible for adding saveFrame() functionality. 

Austin worked on the engine, base classes, pause system, and player, as well as other minor things. 

Paras was not involved with the project outside of initial planning due to issues out of his control.
