

The game starts as soon as the program runs. 

Controls are:
  'a' to go left
  'd' to go right
  'w' to jump and scroll through menu options
  'l' to shoot
  SPACEBAR to pause and select menu options
  's' to scroll through menu options

Points are added every time a weapon is picked up. The weapon is random every time. The difficulty also increases as points are added. 

The game ends when an enemy comes into contact with and kills the player or when an enemy reaches the flag on the right. There may be a bug where the game is lost when jumping over an enemy, though we could not figure out this fix. 

There are animated sprites, pause functionality, and an animation artifact included, so this project has met full extra credit requirements.
